PHY180 Pendulum Tracker
  This project is designed to track the movement of a pendulum. It’s aimed at helping us with our engineering studies by providing a simple Python-based tracker.

Usage
  Clone the Repository:
  
  git clone https://github.com/HaysonC/PHY180-Pendulum.git
  cd PHY180-Pendulum

Run the Tracker:

  python pendulum_tracker.py
Parameters
  There are a few parameters you might need to adjust in the pendulum_tracker.py file:

  Length of Pendulum: Adjust the length to match your pendulum.
  Fps: The framerate of your video
  Color: The color of the target bob
  Thereshold: The threshold sensitivity for the tracking

Modules
  The project uses the following Python modules:
  
  numpy: For numerical operations.
  matplotlib: For plotting the pendulum’s motion.
  Make sure you have these installed before running the tracker:

  pip install numpy matplotlib

Directory Structure
  runs/: This directory is where you can save the output of your runs for future reference.
  Feel free to add more features or improve the code as needed. Happy tracking!
